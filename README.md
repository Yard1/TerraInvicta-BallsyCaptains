# Ballsy Captains

*For Terra Invicta*

This mod allows you to configure multipliers for Evasion chance of AI opponents when space combat is initiated.

You can use the Unity Mod Manager Settings functionality to set your own modifiers for both alien and human opponents separately. By default, aliens are half as likely to evade.

You can, of course, set the multiplier to 0 if you really want to stop them from running.

**The evasion chance is not taken into account if the Evade stance is forced by the game.** This happens when eg. an alien fleet is carrying an army or a Hydra.

The mod requires Unity Mod Manager to function. To install Unity Mod Manager, download version 0.25.0 or later version from Nexus Mods (https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/21).

Install Unity Mod Manager using Doorstop Proxy installation method.
